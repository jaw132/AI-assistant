This is the first version of the UI which used the PyQt5 library to run a flask web app as
a local desktop application. The problem was Javascript wasn't able to run on the
client side and that limited the functionality greatly.
There are two options from this point:
1. Move to a native web app
2. Have the set up as flask desktop app and the assistant as a python app (e.g. QT, pygame etc.)
